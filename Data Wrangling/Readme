This project was completed as part of the WGU Data Analytics course.  The purpose of this project was to learn how to pull information from an open
source of data and then clean and convert the data into an excel spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from Open Street Maps, and I took the data from
this area where I live and cleaned the data to ensure that all of the street names matched and the county name was just the county and not the 
county and the state.  The data was then exported into an excel spreadsheet, and then upload into an Access database that I created.  The data was
then queried to probe the data for some simple information.

Items to update:
1. Add the raw data to the folder - the raw data was too large to upload
2. Add the database to the folder - the database was too large to upload
