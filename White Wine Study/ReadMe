This project was completed as part of the WGU Data Analytics Program.  The purpose of this project was to learn the R programming
language.  In this project, I imported a data set about white wine qualities, and performed some exploratory analysis on the data.
The project contains univariate, bivariate, and nultivariate analysis on various wine quality factors.  The final section of the
project contains 3 refined plots and analysis that cover the main findings of the project.
