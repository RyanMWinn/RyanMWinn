- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan Winn
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and using numbers to objectively solve problems.  I am mostly interested in sports analytics such as soccer, hockey, and football, but I am open to all kinds of analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, and other data analytics tools.  I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in Data Analytics and Data Management. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sports data focusing on soccer data.
